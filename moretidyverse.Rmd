Description: Take the time to explore the lesser known functions and packages of the Tidyverse. Learn about how to access googlesheets, use times/dates, manipulate text, use functional programming to replace loops, and more.

Learning objectives

- What packages are in the tidyverse
- Understand functional programming







> The tidyverse is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures.

## Core Tidyverse

```{r, message = TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
```



### [tibble](https://tibble.tidyverse.org)

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/tibble.png")
```


`tibble::tribble` is a useful function if you want to manually input a small amount of data.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
tibble::tribble( ~column1, ~column2, ~column3,
                 "a", 1, TRUE,
                 "b", 2, FALSE)
```



`tibble::glimpse` is similar to `str` but can be embedded in pipelines as it invisibly returns the original data.

```{r}
tibble::glimpse(mtcars)
```

#### Exercise

Use `tribble()` to manually input some data

### [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org)


```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/dplyr.png")
```
 
 `dplyr::rename` provides the renaming ability of `dplyr::select` but it doesn't subset.
 
`dplyr::transmute` is similar to `dplyr::mutate` except only columns specified are kept.

`dplyr::starts_with`/`dplyr::contains`/`dplyr::ends_with` are useful helper functions to enable easy selection of columns.

`dplyr::relocate` is a very useful function that enables you to relocate columns to specific locations. It uses a `.before` or `.after` argument to specify where you to more the column(s) to.

`dplyr::across` lets you apply a function or functions across multiple columns. This is usually used in conjunction with `dplyr::summarise` or `dplyr::mutate`.

`dplyr::c_across` lets you combine values from across multiple columns, such as performing a summarising function on select columns.

`dplyr::case_when` is useful in situations where you would have multiple ifelses.

### [tidyr](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org)


```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/tidyr.png")
```

`tidyr::nest`/`tidyr::unnest`

`tidyr::unite`/`tidyr::separate` will either combine columns with a separator, or split to new columns based on a separator. `tidyr::separate_rows` will separate a column based on a separator but into separate rows, duplicating the related row data with it.

`tidyr::crossing` provides a mechanism to create all permutations by 'crossing' the values in two vectors. This is particularly useful when combined with `purrr` for running a function on all sub-groups within your data. 

`tidyr::drop_na` is function that provides a way to remove rows that contain missing data. If a column(s) is specified rows are only removed if the missing data is in the specific columns.

`tidyr::replace_na` is a function that lets you specify replacement values for your missing values. The values are specified using a named list, with the names corresponding to the columns your want to replace the data in.

### [stringr](https://stringr.tidyverse.org)


```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/stringr.png")
```

- `stringr::str_detect`
- `stringr::str_remove`
- `stringr::str_extract`

### [readr](https://readr.tidyverse.org)


```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/readr.png")
```

- `readr::read_csv_chunked`

`readr::parse_number` is an extremely useful function to know about if you are reading data into R that you know is numerical in nature but might contain extra characters such as units.

```{r}
text_to_parse <- c(" 0.4m", "-6", "a5", "1E-2", "24%", "3e2")

readr::parse_number(text_to_parse)
```

### [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org)

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/ggplot2.png")
```

The majority of `ggplot2` functions are specific to the type of visualisation that is being created and well covered by the cheatsheet. There is one however that can be very helpful to know about.


`ggplot2::theme_set` allows you to apply a theme to all of your ggplots. It would usually be called near the start of a script.


```{r}
# Set the theme to theme_bw for all following plots
ggplot2::theme_set(theme_bw())
```

### [forcats](https://forcats.tidyverse.org)


```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/forcats.png")
```

- `forcats::relevel`
- `forcats::reorder`
- `forcats::recode`


<div class='exercise'>
#### Exercise

Given the following code that creates a box plot, use `forcats` to re-order the boxes so that they are in descending order (longest flipper length on th left)

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)

penguins %>% 
  drop_na(species, flipper_length_mm) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = fct_reorder(species, flipper_length_mm), 
             y = flipper_length_mm)) + 
  geom_boxplot()
```


</div>


### [purrr](https://purrr.tidyverse.org)


```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/purrr.png")
```

- `purrr::map`
- `purrr::walk`
- `purrr::transpose`
- `purrr::keep`/`purrr::discard`/`purrr::pluck`

## Extra Tidyverse

- readxl
- googlesheets4

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(googlesheets4)

# grab the url from the browser for your sheet
url <- "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MbE2_XUfQ9KwfKAJhEDPb6KgOg2EaoXr5IN2F-hjBNI/edit#gid=0"

# read the sheet in
my_google_sheet <- read_sheet(url)
```

The first time running `read_sheet` you will be asked to authenticate and a web broswer will open up.

- lubridate
    - `lubridate::ymd`
- hms
- magrittr
    - `magrittr::%$%`
    - `magrittr::%T%`
- glue
    - `glue::glue`
- dtplyr
- dbplyr
