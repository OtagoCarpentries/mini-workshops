# Repetition and Functions

This 2 hour workshop is designed to introduce the concepts of:

- Creating your own functions in R
- Repeating tasks in R efficiently

It assumes you know how to:
- assign values to objects/variables
- Use an R function e.g. mean()


Motivation:

Often users will find themselves in the position of wanting to do something in R that might not be immediately available as an existing function but they know what they want to be able to do, just not **how** to do it. This is where creating your own functions is extremely useful.

Secondly, you might find that you are copy and pasting the same code over and over again in order to do something multiple times. Here is where learning how to efficiently repeat tasks comes in use. A common example would be reading in many data files to process.


Learning objetives:

- Functions
	- create functions
	- conditionals
	- arguments

Repetition
