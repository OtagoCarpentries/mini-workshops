## RMarkdown

In rmd the code chunk `eval` option takes more than just `TRUE` or `FALSE` - if you want to selectively run lines within a rmd code chunk you can exclude them explicitly:

````
```{r, eval = c(-1,-3)}`r ''`
1

3

5 # only this line will evaluate
```
````

```{r, eval = c(-1,-3), echo = TRUE}
1

3

5 # only this line will evaluate
```
